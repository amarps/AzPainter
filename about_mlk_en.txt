  About mlk
=================================

mlk is a homebrew GUI building library.


 # Options
---------------------------

  You can view the options common to mlk with the --help-mlk option at run time.


 # About data files
---------------------------

  External files used by the app (such as translation files) are installed
  in "<INSTALL_DIR>/share/<APPNAME>".

  In the app, these files are loaded relative to the executable file,
  so if the files are in the same state as the directory structure at the time of installation,
  you can run them without installing them under /usr.


 # MLK_APPDATADIR Environment variable
-----------------------------------------

  You can specify the data file directory in any location
  by setting the environment variable MLK_APPDATADIR,
  such as $ MLK_APPDATADIR=<DIR> <EXE>, when running the app.


=================================
  About GUI style settings
=================================

If you create the configuration file "az-mlk-style.conf"
in the specified directory, you can specify the font and icon theme.

Since you need to create this configuration file yourself,
create a file in the specified directory and write it directly,
or edit it with "mlk style editor" and save it.


 # Configuration file directory
--------------------------------

  When the app starts, az-mlk-style.conf will be searched in the following order.
  
  ~/.config/<APPNAME>/az-mlk-style.conf
  ~/.config/az-mlk-style.conf

  Common settings are set in the ~/.config/az-mlk-style.conf file,
  and if you want to change the settings for each app,
  create a file in the directory where the settings file for each app is saved.


 # Contents of the configuration file
---------------------------------------

  To write the value directly to the configuration file, write as follows.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[style]
font=<FONT VALUE>
icon_theme=<NAME>

[color]
..COLORS..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


=================================
  Specifying an icon theme
=================================

* If the icon is not displayed, you need to explicitly specify the icon theme.

In icon_theme=<NAME>,
specify the name (directory name) of the icon theme placed in the following directory.

  /usr/share/icons
  /usr/local/share/icons
  ~/.icons
  ~/.local/share/icons

If you want to use the icon theme in /usr/share/icons/Faenza,
specify "icon_theme=Faenza", where the directory name "Faenza" is the theme name.

If no icon theme is specified, the icon theme will be searched from the above directory
and the first one found will be used.


=================================
  Font specification
=================================

(Exsample)
~~~~~~~~~~~~
font=family=DejaVu Sans;style=Book;size=10;
~~~~~~~~~~~~

After "font=" is the value that specifies the font.
Describe multiple values in the format NAME=value, separating each with a ';'.

- Half-width spaces as characters can be described as they are.
  It is not necessary to enclose it with "" etc.
  If enclosed, " itself is treated as part of the string.

- If it contains ';' as a character, write '\;'.

- Do not write extra spaces before or after the delimiter ';'.

- Font family names and style names can be listed with
  $ fc-list (fontconfig tool).
